                <h2>Cognitive Edge Computing</h2>
                <p>Cognitive computing is transforming the way we perceive the world. Today, applications of cognitive computing rely on machine learning models that are trained in the cloud and inference requests are made in real-time using end-user edge devices. This, thus far, has largely been the way that cognitive services are deployed. However, concerns over security, privacy, network connectivity etc. are sparking a paradigm shift in cognitive computing. Interest is rapidly growing in deploying training and inference engines at the edge, which in and of itself is evolving at an astounding pace.</p>
                <p>Bringing cognitive computing to the edge devices opens up several new opportunities and challenges for researchers. Edge devices are short on resources, such as power, networking, storage, compute etc. Therefore, cognitive edge computing requires us to understand the issues and discover novel solutions.</p>
                <p>The workshop is meant to foster an interactive discussion about emerging application domains and the role of cognitive computing in these new domains. In addition, the workshop is meant to lead to new discussions and insights on cognitive algorithms, architectures and system-level design.</p>

                    <p>Tentatively, the program will host a variety of speakers from both industry and academia. Topics will include applications such as AR/VR and robotics, algorithms needed for cognitive agents, low-power mobile systems and solutions, etc. Below is our confirmed list of speakers.</p>
                    <h4>Robotics: <a href="https://www.itri.org.tw/eng/Content/Management/Contents.aspx?SiteID=1&MmmID=617731521672713673&MSid=653414750733631031">Prof. Jwu-Sheng Hu</a></h4>
                    <p>VP and General Director, Mechanical and System Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research Institute (<a href="https://www.itri.org.tw/eng/">ITRI</a>)<br>Professor, Department of ECE, National Chiao Tung University</p>
                    <p><b>Title</b>: Practice and Advanced Technology Development of ITRI’s Robotics Program</p>
                    <p style="font-size:100%"><b>Abstract</b>: According to various market forecast, the market of intelligent robot will grow from
12.2 billion USD in 2011 to 33.6 billion USD in 2021. The increasing labor cost, 
demand of production quality and aging society continue to drive both the industrial 
and service robot installations. The robotics industry is looking into a bright future 
from the analysis of IFR (International Federation of Robotics):
1) Global competition requires modernization of production facilities.
2) Energy-efficiency and new materials require new production means.
3) Human-machine collaboration will open up new applications.
4) Growing consumer markets (e.g., wearable devices) require expansion of 
production capacities.
5) Decline in products' life-cycle and increase in the variety of products require 
flexible automation.
6) Technical improvements of industrial robots will increase the use of robots in the 
general industry and in small and medium sized companies.
7) Improved quality requires sophisticated high tech robot systems.
8) Robots improve the quality of work by taking over dangerous, tedious and dirty 
jobs that are not possible or safe for humans to perform.
Industrial technology Research Institute (ITRI) of Taiwan has actively engaged in 
robotics research to assist Taiwan’s manufacturing industry in adopting robot-based 
automation. In this talk, an overview of the research program will be given first to 
explain the technology R&D focus. Several examples of automation in different 
industrial sector are presented, particularly for the implementation of robot 
technology. A number of advanced developments in robot technology are introduced 
which cover vision, actuator, force feedback, tactile sensing, localization and high 
precision motion control etc. Lastly, the research of power exoskeleton for spinal cord 
injury (SCI) patients is explained along with clinical trial results.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:100%"><b>Abstract</b>: We will explore the current VR craze, including the popular smartphone game: 
                                        Pokemon Go, and four major technical problems to solve in VR/AR, namely (i) Display 
                                        resolution high enough not to see visible pixels, (ii) Latency (from motion to photons)
                                        to avoid dizziness, (iii) Tracking (enough precision) so that manipulation and 
                                        registration is satisfactory, (iv) Vergence-accommodation conflict inherent to all 
                                        stereoscopic displays. We will explain the current state of the art and potential 
                                        solutions.</p>
